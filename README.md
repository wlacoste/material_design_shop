# material_design_shop
This repository contains a simple React application I made as a learning project for learning to use React. 
The application simulates a basic online shop. During development I got to learn about component creation, usage of different hooks, API calls, state management, and data validation.
Getting Started

To run the application locally on your machine, please follow the steps below:

    Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/wlacoste/material_design_shop.git

Navigate to the project's root directory:


    cd material_design_shop

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

    npm install

Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

    npm run dev


Key Features
Component Creation

Throughout the development of this application, you will find various reusable components that have been created to encapsulate specific functionalities. These components promote code reusability and improve maintainability. You will find components such as:

    
Hooks Usage

React hooks are extensively used in this project to manage component state and lifecycle-related functionalities. Some of the hooks used include:


API Calls

The application makes API calls to retrieve data required for the shop, such as product information and user details. To get the date I used the fake store api

For state management I mostly used the useState and useContext hooks. To offer the posibility to add, remove and edit the products that were fetch to the API. Note that it is only a mock of changes. Reloading the page will result in changes made to the products being lost.
Conclusion

This project has been developed to gain hands-on experience with React and its core concepts. By exploring the code, you will find examples of component creation, hooks usage, API integration, state management, and data validation.
